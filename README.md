# reveilid

Current status: Non-working, experimental

This is a pure python reimplementation of [Veilid](https://veilid.com/), written with the goal of understanding the protocol, and acting as a platform for further security research.

Note: This requires installing my fork of [py-ed25519-bindings](https://github.com/DavidBuchanan314/py-ed25519-bindings) which supports blake3+ed25519ph signatures.
